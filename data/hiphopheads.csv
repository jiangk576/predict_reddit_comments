"To me Ice Cube used to sound so aggressive. Now, his flow tends to be rather slow. When I first heard Straight Outta Compton in '06, I was so surprised he sounded so aggressive, since at the time I had only heard the singles from Laugh Now, Cry Later. He sounds like his voice has aged (duh) but also like he's really out of shape compared to his early 90s voice.",,,,JayElectricity,,,1441286563,t5_2rh4c,t3_3jfdsq,t3_3jfdsq,-1,1444146350,0,0,cup7gsu,hiphopheads,-1,,

"I hate this review. Granted, Meth is a little late with the Breaking Bad references, but why is that a big deal?

&gt;If that doesn’t kill your vibe, look at the tracklisting of The Meth Lab: of the 19 tracks, only three are credited solely to Method Man. 

All rappers boast like that. He's earned his right to be bitter abouut 
Most current rappers are guilty of having too many features. 

&gt;Otherwise, you know Meth’s steez—Wu-Tang’s for the children, other rappers need to pull their pants up, hip-hop peaked when you could still hear Method Man songs on the radio. 

He's earned his right to be bitter about the state of rap. 

&gt;To Meth’s credit, he hasn’t fallen the fuck off as hard as Inspectah Deck

The reviewer obviously hasn't heard either of Czarface's albums. If he has, then he just had bad taste.
